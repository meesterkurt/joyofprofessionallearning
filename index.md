            <p>MKG only hires experts.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Experts are quantified by having 8+ years of experience in a specific service. Collectively MKG has 50+ years of experience. Your account will never be handled by anyone below a senior role. It’s not fair to the assistants in the industry who are handed more responsibility then they’re ready for or fair to you, the client.</p>
