            <p>We have all been professional learning coaches.</p>

          <p>The Joy of Professional Learning introduces recipes for learning, a different approach to current professional development. The recipes represent what a global community of educators has learned over more than a hundred years of combined experience in education.</p>
          <p>When you create your school’s professional learning events, you integrate professionalism, sustainability, relevance, interactivity, and classroom examples that support a personal learning experience for every teacher and leader.</p>
          <p>We also know that it takes great educators like you to make this happen. It takes vision and a tribe. It takes planning - what to do tomorrow and what to do throughout the year to keep ongoing professional learning a vibrant part of the school culture.</p>
