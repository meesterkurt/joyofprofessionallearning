          <p>The Joy of Professional Learning introduces recipes for learning, a different approach to current professional development. The recipes represent what a global community of educators has learned over more than a hundred years of combined experience in education.
          <p>We believe teachers are learners first. Let's create your school’s professional learning plan and events together and integrate professionalism, relevance, interactivity, and classroom examples that keep teachers as learners at the core of the experience.  We will join you to plan year long sustainable and systemic change in your organization. The kind of learning you want to see in the classroom. We also know that it takes great educators like you to make this happen. That is why we are committed to developing a close relationship with your planning team to design engaging professional learning with a clear purpose and vision. It takes planning - and we want to be your partners throughout the year to keep ongoing professional learning a vibrant part of the school culture.
