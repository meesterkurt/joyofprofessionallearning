These last few weeks I have been learning about learning. From designing interdisciplinary units at the Museum of Natural History in NYC then in a Project Zero workshop and panel discussion about participatory creativity. It was an amazing experience learning about how create when we move from the individual “I”, from collaboration where everyone feels they need to do everything to  “WE“, calling on the collective genius of a team and determining how each “actor” fills the roles on a team in a distributed process of ideas. All of this has lead to the development of our JPL innovative products. 

In the Participatory Creativity workshop we concetualized creativity with LEGO’s. We produced a poem in a new medium; through music and art and construction and performance. We talked about who owns the idea when ideas are evolving. What we discovered is ideas are not forged in isolation but from the work of others and grown from each of us who have a profile of participation. The collective genius as I like to say.

The Joy of Professional Learning has that wow factor of participatory creativity down to a fine science!  Together we are the collective creative, each participating in our skill talent to make creativity deliberate. Our ideas are always evolving through the embedded succession of innovative services and products that incorporate both novelty and utility. We know ideas are not fixed, they are created in a social space. They take place over time with markers in the development of a service and product. We built an exhibition that shows our thinking in the Joy of Professional Learning!

Take a look at Kurt’s work these past few weeks.  We are particularly proud of the learning exercices we created at the leadership conference uLEAD in Calgary and for our upcoming events at ISTE18. From the Playground to Recipes workshop to iPad teacher Academy

Join us for participatory creativity as you engage in the learning experiences. It’s been inspirational. We have created our "Joy" of Professional Learning!
