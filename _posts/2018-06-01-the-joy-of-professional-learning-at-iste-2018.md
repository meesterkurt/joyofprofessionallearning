We are coming to ISTE and we could not be more excited! 

At the Joy of Professional Learning we believe our recipes engage educators in professional practice. We are committed to planning sessions throughout the year that are new and emerging learning opportunities combined with days to practice what we learned as a team. Professional Learning can be a combination of the 2, new learning and professional practice.

"Better doesn't mean more. Better means generous, sustainable, worthy. Better means connection and quality and opportunity, too.”

Join us in professional practice as we take our learning experiences to new heights.
