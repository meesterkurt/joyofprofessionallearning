"We are always a Diad: half teacher half student. Our goal must always be to become hopelessly curious to a broader scope of our world than the mere limitations of our vertical career.‚Äù - Jay Abraham.

We were invited to the first Tablet Days conference in Switzerland inspired entirely by our books. 

Christine kicked off the conference with the first of 15 Showcases (1 in 3), highlighting how "Joy is the engine of growth." Bruce Mau, The Third Teacher

The conference featured Kurt as the Keynote Speaker. His presentation to an audience of a few hundred educators focused on "Raising the Bar for Professional Learning" with a strong message on teachers are learners first.

The sessions at the conference were all titled "The Joy of Professional Learning" and each guided by a recipe.

It is magical to see our books come to life and teachers have a renewed love of learning and how that translate to a new level of excitement in the classroom.
