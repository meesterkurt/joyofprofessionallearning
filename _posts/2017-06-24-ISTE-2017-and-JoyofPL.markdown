Our recipes are coming to life in our first ever 3 hour session “Recipes for Professional Learning” where our global team of professional learning coordinators will guide technology integration coaches, curriculum coaches, professional learning coordinators and administrators in designing innovative ways to deliver professional learning around your district goals.
