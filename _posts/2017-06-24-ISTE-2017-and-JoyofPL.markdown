We are here at ISTE and it’s an exciting time for The Joy of Professional Learning. Our recipes are coming to life in our first 3 hour session “Recipes fro Professional Learning” where our global team of professional learning coordinators will guide technology integration coaches, curriculum coaches, professional learning coordinators and administrators in designing innovative ways to deliver professional learning around your district goals. Using tools like Methodkit and #HashtagEDU with leaders who will work with our #joyofpl team to design their professional learning plan for school or districtwide back-to-school professional learning. < https://conference.iste.org/2017/program/search/detail_presenter.php?id=108114820>
