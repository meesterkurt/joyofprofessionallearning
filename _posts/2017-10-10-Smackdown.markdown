Often when attending a workshop, participants are faced with an overwhelming program of possibilities, each with perhaps just a short description from which to make their choices. 

How can one best select their professional learning path? 

In order to facilitate more personalized, better informed professional learning I recently employed one of the Joy of PL recipes. 

Using a Smackdown format (Book 3, Joy of Innovative Professional Learning, page 12) for a whole group opening session was the perfect way to kickoff a day long conference with joy!

First I created a Google Slides presentation and shared it will all presenters so that they could add content to their session's individual slide. 

Embedding self-playing timers made the experience fast-paced and fun! With the help of a colleague, we tag-teamed the experience. 

Alternating from side to side, we moved the mic at each buzzer. 

Participants in the audience got to hear a 30 second pitch for every session that promoted more than simply the descriptions in the program. 

At the conclusion of the Session Smackdown we declared everyone a winner as they were all now able to attend the rest of the event with more certainty that they were selecting the best sessions for their professional learning needs. 


We used Google Slides to facilate the Smackdown: [Smackdown Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12gkeA3bWxozbGVfSoVjNuwwb2x4-aevXSltaorlpkP8/edit?usp=sharing)
