The new 15 minute Faculty Meeting - The Stand Up
------
When I first read "Scrum How to Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland, I was intrigued by the process developers use to move a project forward. I thought about how this would be a good way to replace the long end of the day, once a month faculty meeting. My why is relationships. I know that no good work happens in isolation. These would be the meetings that foster relationship building, collaboration and ultimately become a better use of time. Everyone has 15 minutes. 

So I suggested we give it a try. We had our first standup meeting in 2013 with our administrative team as practice. It was so effective and sucessfull that we implemeted it with our high school faculty. We never looked back and the Stand Up became and still is to this day, the faculty meeting.

Get started by following these simple suggestions:

The RULES of the Standup: 
------
Be true to the mission

Choose a Scrum Master - the person who facilitates the Stand Up

Choose a day of the week and stick to it. (Wednesday afternoon, right after school is a great time)

The standup meeting is never longer than 15 minutes

Everyone stands in the circle. (Standing makes it slightly uncomfortable and ensures the meeting will not to go into overtime)

If any member in the standup has questions, concerns or roadblocks that someone else can help with then the scrum master will ask for that team to take the conversation off-line. Off-line means if it does not involve the entire group

The meeting is not mandatory but strongly encouraged

To START the Meeting:
------

The timekeeper sets the clock for 15 minutes

The administrator AKA The Scrum Master starts the meeting with announcements. The need to knows

Each member of the faculty goes around the circle to share something about their day or passes with "I had a good day". The share can be a win, a challenge, an announcement, a what if...

If someone misses the standup meeting someone else will make sure that the missing member knows what happened in standup

The stand up ends when the time keep calls time

What we learned about the 15 minute Stand up Faculty Meeting is that it is about calibrating relationships, camaraderie, our sense of belonging, face to face time with our tribe, a time and place to safely express a frustation, and the chance to bring joy, laughter, and a common purpose to our work together toward our greater goals. 

Three years later, it is a rare occasion that someone misses the Stand Up.
