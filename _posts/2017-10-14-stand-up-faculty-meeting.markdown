Changing the sit and get faculty meeting to a Stand Up
------
When I first read "Scrum The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/1847941109/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0/131-4681130-1166934?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VEZXPNVKJ3Z2KFCFEPSG), I was intrigued by the process developers use to move a team and project forward. I thought about how this would be a good way to replace the long, end of the day, once a month faculty meeting. My why is relationships and relationship building. 

I know that no good work happens in isolation. These meetings would foster relationship building, collaboration and ultimately become a better use of our time. Everyone has 15 minutes. I suggested we give it a try. We had our first standup meeting in 2013 with our administrative team to practice the stand up meeting and gain flow in our processes. It was so effective and successfull that we implemented it with our high school faculty and changed the old style faculty meeting forever. We never looked back and the Stand Up became, and still is to this day, the faculty meeting.

Get started by following these simple suggestions:

The RULES of the Standup: 
------
Be true to the mission

Choose a Scrum Master - this person facilitates the Stand Up.

Choose a day of the week and stick to it. (Wednesday afternoon, right after school is a great time)

The standup meeting is never longer than 15 minutes.

Everyone stands in the circle. (Standing makes it slightly uncomfortable and ensures the meeting will not to go into overtime)

If any member in the standup has questions, concerns or roadblocks that someone else can help with then the scrum master will ask for that team to take the conversation off-line. Off-line means the tasks do not involve the entire group.

The meeting is not mandatory but strongly encouraged.

To START the Meeting:
------

The timekeeper sets the clock for 15 minutes

The administrator AKA The Scrum Master starts the meeting with announcements. The need to knows.

Each member of the faculty goes around the circle to share something about their day or passes with "I had a good day". The share can be a win, a challenge, an announcement, a what if...

If someone misses the standup meeting someone else will make sure that the missing member knows what happened in standup.

The stand up ends when the time keep calls time.

What we learned about the 15 minute Stand Up Faculty Meeting is that it is about calibrating relationships, camaraderie, our sense of belonging, face to face time with our tribe, a time and place to safely express a frustration, and the chance to bring joy, laughter, and a common purpose of our work together toward our greater goals. 

Three years later, it is a rare occasion that someone misses the Stand Up.
