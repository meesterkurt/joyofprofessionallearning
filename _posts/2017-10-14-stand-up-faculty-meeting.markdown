The new 15 minute Faculty Meeting - The Stand Up

When I first read Scrum How to Twice the Work in Half the Time by Jeff Sutherland, I was intrigued by the process developers use to move a project forward. I thought about how this would be wonderful way to replace the hour-long once a month faculty meeting. I suggested we give it a try have a weekly standup meeting. We tried our first standup meeting in 2013 with our administrative team and then our high school faculty.   We never looked back and the Stand Up became the faculty meeting.

The RULES of the Standup: 

Be true to the mission

Choose a Scrum Master - the person who facilitates the Stand Up

Choose a day of the week and stick to it. (Wednesday afternoon, right after school is a great time)

The standup meeting is never longer than 15 minutes

Everyone stands in the circle. (Standing makes it slightly uncomfortable and ensures the meeting will not to go into overtime)

If any member in the standup has questions, concerns or roadblocks that someone else can help with then the scrum master will ask for that team to take the conversation off-line. Off-line means if it does not involve the entire group

The meeting is not mandatory but strongly encouraged

To START the Meeting:
-----

The timekeeper sets the clock for 15 minutes

The administrator AKA The Scrum Master starts the meeting with announcements. The need to knows

Each member of the faculty goes around the circle to share something about their day or passes with "I had a good day". The share can be a win, the challenge, an announcement, a what if

If someone misses the standup meeting someone will make sure that the missing member knows what happened in standup

The stand up ends when the time keep calls time

What we learned about the 15 minute Faculty Meeting is that it really is the calibration of relationships, the camaraderie of the team, and the chance to bring joy, laughter, and a sense of all working together toward the common purpose.
