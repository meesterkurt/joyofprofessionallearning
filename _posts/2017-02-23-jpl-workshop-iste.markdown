We are so excited to be hosting our first @joyofpl workshop on creating professional learning for Back to School. We have invited coaches, principals, curriculum coordinators, professional development coordinators and other school leaders to join us to first experience professional learning  then design a professional learning plan aligned to district wide goals. We have used this personalized planning design for back to school professional learning with school leaders around the world. The plan extends to year long learning events through thoughtful consideration of the whole school mission.
