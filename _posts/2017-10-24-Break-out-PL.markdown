Break Out of the Old PD
------

This weekend we broke through Professional Development and into Professional Learning.

Last week Friday a team of innovative educators came together to learn from each other. I knew their technology skills we're at a high level, so this time I wanted to challenge them using the four C’s: communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity. 

I really wanted to put joy into their professional learning. After all it was a Friday evening after a long week of work. With my gaming background, I dived deep into the BreakoutEDU website. It didn't take me very long to find the ideal team challenge.

Materials were printed, locks prepared and the timer was set. I must say, it was a joy to watch this group as the facilitator of this learning experience. I quickly saw the different styles of tackling a problem. Clear roles on the team emerged and  were quickly divided. 

During the reflection moment we used “The roles on a team cards” to reflect and come up with a different game plan for the next challenge.

Next time we want to split the group in two rooms, solve the puzzles to help each other reach the end goal.

Oh, and if you wondered if they broke out… YES they did!!!
