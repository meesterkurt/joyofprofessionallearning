The Team Role Cards are a compliment to our Joy of Professional Learning Book Series. This game challenges you to move a team forward when faced with a new challenge. 

The cards can be used in the classroom for group work to enhance collaboration or with your team of professionals to accelerate a project. 

Every role on the team gives specific characteristics to each player. Pick a card and complete a task/project, no matter how big or small. with your team based on the role you randomly chosen.
