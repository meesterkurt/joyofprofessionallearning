meta: The Joy of Professional LEarning consists of a dynamic, experienced team of
  educators from all networks and educational backgrounds. As educators we have a
  broad experience in teaching and learning with the most modern media. We are teachers
  who are faced with the constraints and opportunities within the four walls of a
  classroom and within our school culture. That is why we know how to integrate professional
  learning experiences that transform lessons in the classroom. We ensure that professional
  learning for teachers as learners first emulate our expectations students learning
  bring their new learning into professional practice without an extra effort, but
  as a change agent to give lessons a new boost.
