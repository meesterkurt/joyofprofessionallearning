This set of Apple Teacher App Dice is a special edition to our app die family. Hand crafted, each set comes with a deck of cards that offers multiple suggestions for way to create beautiful projects. Roll the dice and accept the challenge on your journey to becoming an Apple Teacher.

The dice are a combination of content creation apps and the player is challenged with rolling the dice to create a new digital story.

The app dice include instruction cards that give suggested activities to get started. Of course you are encouraged to create your own lessons.

Each set comes in a tin container for storage and the cards are printed on Archival Paper, Acid/Lignin Free, FSC: Supporting responsible use of forest resources .
