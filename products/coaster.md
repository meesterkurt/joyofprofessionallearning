Our #joyofpl team is creating new learning experiences. We designed these coasters to use for ideating goals for professional learning, project and team planning. These cards are a hexagonal in shape to help the team connect ideas. We love to challenge teams to think through goals by scribbling, writing, coloring and connecting their thoughts. As each person on the team jots down ideas based in a goal, the team then searches for common themes in the process. Connecting the edges helps bring out the best ideas of the team.

Each set comes with 50 cards. "joyofpl says: great ideas, sketches, recipes. They all start here."
