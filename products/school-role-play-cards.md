We make learning fun!

Our new school character card game requires the learner to see a challenge from a different point of view. Draw a card and you will become a Superintendent, teacher, student, librarian, and more. 10 characters in all that make up the heart and soul of a school community.

Given a scenario each player will address the story from the point of view of character on the card using the profile builder questions on the back of the card.

Great for professional learning and story telling when paired with our Joy of Professional Learning recipe The Magnificent Minute in our [Leadership book](http://www.joyofprofessionallearning.com/#books).

The cards come packaged in a tin can for safe keeping and the are printed Archival Paper, Acid/Lignin Free, FSC: Supporting responsible use of forest resources.
