Our hashtag game was created for the Joy of Professional Learning and featured in our recipe books. Professional learning is inspirational and engaging. Thatâ€™s why we designed different recipes clearly outlining the time, tools, and ingredients to inspire you to cook up delicious learning activities for teachers and leaders.

Each comes with 100 #hashtag cards in 3 different editions in 3 colors, red, blue, and yellow, Our cards are printed premium cards in matte finish.

The object of the professional learning is to draw a card at random, then using the revealed hashtag make a picture, drawing and then write a tweet. Post your final result on twitter with the hashtag on the card and #joyofpl.

The game recipe can be found in our new book The Joy of Professional Learning - Game Edition coming soon to the iBooks store.
