I am an educational advisor on a K8-12 school. I have a MSc degree in educational science and technology. 8 years ago I started working in a secondary school in the Netherlands. My assignment was to start a 1:1 laptop project, because the director thought it would be a nice goodbye present. I soon found out that was the worst motive to start working with technology. Teachers were not that into it, they hadnâ€™t thought about infrastructure, content, professional development and technology at all or at least not enough. However I did find 1 location of our school that immediately saw the potential for students working with technology. They realised they could meet the needs of individual students a lot better and could be more creative as well. This was where my journey to help teachers become learners started. Together with the leader of the location and the teachers we shaped a concept in which we try to help students to set goals and achieve those goals. We help them to excel and develop their talents. iPads and technology are tools we use.
