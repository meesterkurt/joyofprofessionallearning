I am a Ph.D. in evolutionary behaviour and communication with honors.

I have been dancing since I was six years old and at 16 years old I started in the Swedish junior national team, I then went on to the National team. In 2002 I became a professional dancer (http://www.beren.se) and started to dance on the world tour and I have represented Sweden at the European and World Championships years 2003, 2004 and 2006. I have lived in London, Moscow and Los Angeles, where I was teaching dancing and developing my own dancing. I came back to Sweden in November 2006. I participated in two seasons of TV4:s Let’s Dance 2007, 2008 and I started and ran two dance schools.

In 2009 I sold my dance schools and started to teach science. At the school we had one to one MacBooks and my first course to teach was an evolution. I’ve found that the book we had was in many levels totally irrelevant when it came to today’s view on evolution. Therefore I decided to go bookless and I have never looked back.

Now I work in Sweden with schools and municipalities to enhance learning and I have opened the program iSkolor.org where swedish schools can publish courses and collaborate on iTunes U.
