I spent the first 17 years of my teaching career as a middle school social studies educator.  During that time I developed a passion for leveraging technology in my classroom in the name of student learning.  In the summer of 2009 I was accepted into the Apple Distinguished Educator program which just added fuel to my fire.  Because of my work in the classroom and my work as an ADE, I have been asked by my district to fill the role of Technology Integration Specialist. I miss having classes of students but am loving my new role.  I love helping teachers find new and innovative ways to improve learning by leveraging technology.  Currently, I am heading up our districtâ€™s 1-1 iPad initiative.  We are focused on the idea of giving students a mobile and personal education through strategically incorporating a mobile and personal device, the iPad.
