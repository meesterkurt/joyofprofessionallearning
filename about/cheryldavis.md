I like to think I've been helping to support "innovating" by teachers and students for over 40 years in schools. Apple products have been my partners in that push for innovation much of that time. It is wonderful to see that now we are so much further ahead in "technology integration" and that it is no longer a separate part of education but a full partner in teaching and learning. My focus is history and social science curriculum but I have also taught photography, web design, video production and my very favorite - being the high school journalism advisor. Currently I'm the technology specialist in a high school district. I also work often with the Library of Congress and primary source materials. I'm also a former member of the Apple Distinguished Educators Advisory Board and my passion for civic literacy has had me working with the C-SPAN Education team as a senior fellow. I am also a member of the CUE Professional Learning Advisory Committee.  I love authoring in iTunes U and iBook author and working with my fellow ADEs. I was honored to be selected to work with the National Archives to create and publish a Multi-Touch book and iTunes U course on the Chinese Exclusion Act as part of the ADE Residency program.
