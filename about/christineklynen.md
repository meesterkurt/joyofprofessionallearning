Together we can create learning experiences that are focused on new ways to teach and learn, centered on the district's mission that enhances engagement and helps make learning more relevant. Learning for teachers and leaders should model the expectations for active personalized learning in the classroom.

My courses are training courses on creating a culture of innovation, mobile learning, technology integration, and lessons for the classroom that foster creative thinking, problem solving, inquiry, with a community centered focus. 

As a teacher and administrator 1 to 1 schools I know first hand how technology transforms learning.
