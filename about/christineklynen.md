I am a Professional Learning Coach/Consultant
My passion is my talent. I’m a passionate about education. To get a sense of my passion meet me face-to-face. Let's talk about what's possible. I always say see the road not roadblocks so for me there's nothing but possibilities. 

I am passionate about leading teams in planning professional learning strategies around school district yearly vision and goals. Together we can design learning experiences that are focused on new ways to teach and learn. From snapshot presentations to full conferences, I think learning for teachers should model the expectations for active personalized learning in the classroom. I am passionate about education and ways to bring innovation the entire school community. I believe in sharing these stories from our school/ classroom at global conferences. 

I am passionate about designing and delivering professional learning. As an innovation and instructional technology coach, mathematics teacher, and digital media arts curriculum designer and teacher in 1 to 1 schools I have led the way in delivering new ideas in my schools. This work has been the driving force of my career. I sincerely enjoy and thrive in an environment where new ideas, collaboration, and camaraderie are the heart and soul of the school. I'm not your typical cookie-cutter teacher. I believe in a growth mind set as I continue learning. I love technology in education and I have experienced the value technology in the classroom. I truly believe it enhances engagement and helps make learning more relevant.

I love creating meaningful learning experiences for parents, administrators, teachers and students. I believe learning comes from doing, feeling, and understanding through struggles and successes. My recent projects involve collaborative planning with teachers to create iTunes U courses for iPad in 1 to 1 schools. As a leader in collaboration, content creation, and team building, I‘ve worked closely with teachers to create engaging content, instructional design, inquiry learning, and personalized learning. I’ve created training courses centered on mobile learning, technology integration, and lessons for the classroom that foster creative thinking, problem solving, inquiry, with a community centered focus.


Sharing my passion for creative and innovative practices I can seamlessly integrate technology in the classroom. I led a middle high school initiaitve to say goodbye to textbooks and publish all courses in iTunes U courses for 1 to 1 iPad. As a Digital Media Arts and Design teacher I guide students on a journey of visual storytelling and self discovery. I am mathematical and a problem solver. I am an Apple Distinguished Educator and was on the Apple Distinguished Educator Advisory Board, I serve on the ISTE Program Committee, am a Google Certified Trainer and Google Glass Explorer.
