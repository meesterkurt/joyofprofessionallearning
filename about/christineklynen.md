I am the Learning Coach at Square Peg

In my previous roles as Director of Innovation I was the professional team leader working closely with our Design Team to rethink school, sharing innovative ideas and design elements around new ways of teaching and learning. As a tech coach, providing just in time learning opportunities for colleagues, sharing my passion for creative and innovative practices, and seamlessly integrating technology in the classroom. I work with faculty and staff supporting technology and pedagogical initiatives in the classroom. In the 1 to 1 iPad program I create learning opportunities for content creation for all members of the faculty and staff, district wide strategies for innovative uses of technology in the classroom, and best practices for students to consume, create and author content using iPad. And I have an idea!

Sharing my passion for creative and innovative practices I can seamlessly integrate technology in the classroom. I am the team lead for our iTunes U courses for 1 to 1 iPad. As a Digital Media Arts and Design teacher I guide students on a journey of visual storytelling and self discovery. I am mathematical and a problem solver. I am an Apple Distinguished Educator and was on the Apple Distinguished Educator Advisory Board, I serve on the ISTE Program Committee, am a Google Certified Teacher and Google Glass Explorer.
