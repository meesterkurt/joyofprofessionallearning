@ckklynen

I am an Innovator, Leader,  Consultant,  Author,  Vision Former,  Change Maker, Teacher of Teachers, Disrupter, @joyofpl COO. United States

“Let failure be a tailwind not a headwind.”

My skills are centered on coaching, leading teams, and I am committed to designing and delivering professional learning. My partnership with administrators and teachers is key to creating engaging experiences, authoring content, instructional design, inquiry learning, and personalized learning.

I have published courses in iTunes U about creating a culture of innovation, mobile learning, technology integration, and lessons for the classroom that foster creative thinking, problem solving, inquiry, with a community centered focus.

As a teacher and administrator in 1 to 1 schools I know first hand how technology transforms teaching and learning.

My recognitions include Apple Distinguished Educator (ADE), Apple Distinguished Educator Advisory Board (2012-2014, 2017 - Present), AppleTeacher, a Google Certified Teacher, Google Certified Trainer, and I currently serve as a member of the ISTE Program Team.

Contact me as your partner in planning and delivering a new  professional learning.

<p> Over the next few months The Joy of Professional Learning will be working with many schools and sharing our work at conferences. We would love to put your school or conference on our summer calendar too. Bring us to your school to work with the leadership team to design the learning experience for the upcoming school year. We know for sure the core of the learning experience for teachers has immediate impact in the classroom.  We have several openings in our summer calendar, one opening starting in early August. We invite to learn about our services. Let's make back to school feel like it did when we were new learners.
