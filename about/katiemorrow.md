Yearning to empower youth for over two decades, I am a passionate educator and a tireless advocate for technology infused learning experiences for students and teachers. Prior to being named the Instructional Technology Facilitator for Educational Service Unit 8, I taught junior high ELA courses and served as Technology Integration Specialist at O’Neill Public Schools in O’Neill, Nebraska. In this role I provided leadership for over eight years of a 1:1 Mac initiative at O’Neill High School. 

I has been named an Apple Distinguished Educator, Google Certified Teacher, and a SMART Exemplary Educator. I present and lead professional learning experiences, teach graduate courses in technology integration, and serve on the Advisory Boards for the Apple Distinguished Educators program and Challenge Based Learning.
